						<!-- Communication -->
						<h3>Communicating the Service in Publication</h3>

						<p>In this section, we present some indications on how to communicate the Shortcut service best in your publication. These indications are based on our experience during over six years as well as numerous face-to-face surveys with end-users.</p>
						<p>Here we give you general and specific hints as well as various examples how to communicate Shortcut in an optimal way. In general, we distinguish three sorts of communication.</p>
						<ol class="regular_ordered_list">
						<li><span>1.</span><p>The <strong>introductory article</strong> is a full page (or at least half a page) that introduces the Shortcut service to your reader. The service is introduced and explained in detail.</p></li>
						<li><span>2.</span><p>The <strong>permanent infobox</strong> is a short manual on how to get started with Shortcut in three or four simple and understandable steps. This infobox should be present in every issue.</p></li>
						<li><span>3.</span><p>The <strong>call to action</strong> indicates the reader, that for a given page there is additional online information to explore. This information can consist of videos, images, links, etc. The call to action can also ask your readers to share a certain article to their friends.</p></li>
						</ol>
						</p>
				
						<br />
						
						<p><strong>Introductory Article</strong></p>

						<p>The goal of the introductory page is to make your readers familiar with the Shortcut Service and to make them install and use the “Shortcut Reader” app. This is part of the efforts needed in order to instruct your readers how to use Shortcut and why. Therefore, it is important to make the introductory page interesting to read and to get their attention – if possible with corresponding image material.</p>
						<p>Your readers should be informed about the Shortcut service repeatedly. A one-time introduction is not enough, as only a small part of your readers will see it the first time it appears. The following aspects are to be considered.</p>
						<ul class="regular_unordered_list">
							<li><strong>Introductory page.</strong> Dedicate a full page for this in order to introduce your readers to the Shortcut service. Point out in a clear way the added value for your readers and what they need to do for this.</li>
							<li><strong>Positioning.</strong> The introductory article should be positioned in the first part of the magazine. However, it should be shown after the table of content. This is how you achieve the highest attention.</li>
							<li><strong>Visibility.</strong> The introductory article should attract the attention of your readers. The best way to achieve this is to use image material (female faces are working best). For example, a woman holding her Smartphone towards an article.</li>
							<li><strong>Title.</strong> The title receives the highest attention if it is clear and understandable, and makes the reader curious to continue reading. The title is the most important part of the text. You can experiment with it and leave the content the same.</li>
							<li><strong>Fonts and Style.</strong> The introductory text should look like editorial content. If it appears like an ad to the reader, it might be skipped. In order to increase attention, you can highlight it with a “New” tag or similar.</li>
							<li><strong>Whitespace.</strong> Add enough whitespace. The text becomes much better understandable.</li>
							<li><strong>Shortcut Logo.</strong> Mention the Shorcut logo and that behind every article where the logo is printed, there is some additional information.</li>
							<li><strong>Howto.</strong> Show your readers in 3-4 steps how Shortcut works (see below).</li>
							<li><strong>Free App.</strong> Don’t forget to mention that the app is free.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<br />

						<p><strong>Permanent infobox</strong></p>
						
						<p>The infobox is a short and clear manual about how Shortcut works. It should be included in every issue of your title. You can refer to it where ever you have additional content. E.g. “Find out about the secret of ... See infobox on page 4”. Keep the following points in mind.</p>
						<ul class="regular_unordered_list">
							<li><strong>Simplicity.</strong> In a few steps it must be clear to the reader how Shortcut works.</li>
							<li><strong>Repetition.</strong> We suggest to print the infobox in every issue. This is extremely important for a sustainable usage of the service. This way, you will not exclude readers who missed the introductory article.</li>
							<li><strong>Every page is interactive.</strong> Explain your readers that every single page is interactive and can be scanned, shared, or stored on Evernote.</li> 
							<li><strong>Pages with the Shortcut Logo.</strong> The reader should know that there is “only” additional content on pages with the Shortcut logo (see Call to action).</li>
							<li><strong>Use images.</strong> Again, images (icons) help readers to understand how the service works and what they have to do.</li>
						</ul>

						<br />

						<p><strong>Call to action</strong></p>
						
						<p>The call to action invites the reader to use the Shortcut service to achieve a certain goal. This can be watching a video or additional images, accessing a URL, or simply sharing the page with friends. The communication in the call to action has to be adjusted according the situation. Keep the following points in mind.</p>
						<ul class="regular_unordered_list">
							<li><strong>Place on every page that has additional digital content.</strong> Make sure to place the call to action on every page where your readers can explore additional digital content. Remember, without you communicating, readers do not know that you added something to discover.</li>
							<li><strong>Pointer to the infobox.</strong> In the call to action, include an indication to the page number where the infobox is located in your issue. There are always readers who are not familiar with the service.</li>
							<li><strong>Show incentive to the reader.</strong> It should be clear to your readers, what they can expect. For example: “Find out about how to make more money”, or “Participate and win...”, or “get the whole story online via Shortcut”. Avoid obscure call to actions such as “discover more”, or “get a surprise”. Don’t fool your readers, they have very limited attention span and want to know what you have to offer.</li>
							<li><strong>Call to action to share articles.</strong> The sharing function of Shortcut helps you as the editor to increase the number of readers and convert them to subscribers. Therefore, refer your readers regularly to this function.</li>
							<li><strong>Positioning.</strong> Position the call to action on clearly visible places. If there is an image, place it in the image. This is most effective. If there is no image, the upper right or left corner would be the best choice.</li>
						</ul>


						<!-- Providing content 
						<h3>Uploading Publication Pages to Shortcut</h3>

						<p>Publications are uploaded to Shortcut Media with FTP - or more precisely with SFTP (secure FTP) as your content should be stored at a secure location. Each publication has own account that is used for transfers. From the account issues of a publications are imported to the service automatically and issues and pages can be accessed and content managed with Shortcut Manager tool.</p>

						<p><em>Note: Issues are uploaded in PDF format: either as one PDF file or separate files (each page as a separate page, or each article as a separate file). PDF resolution should be 72dpi.</em></p>

						<p>It is most important that files are named using service naming convention described below.
						We recommend that individual users would use WinSCP or Cyberduck FTP clients for manual transfer.
						SFTP Server</p>

						<p>SFTP server used is sftp://upload.shortcutmedia.com.
						Shortcut representative will send dedicated account details to the publisher.</p>
						
						
						<p><strong>Upload Timing</strong></p>

						<p>Publication PDF file(s) has to be uploaded to the service before issues are publicly available. Magazines preferably at least 2 days before public publication date. For daily newspapers SFTP transfer is automated and PDF file(s) are uploaded during the night and are imported in the early hours of the day to the system (typically around 2am local time). Automatic transfer scheduling is agreed with representative of Shortcut.</p>
						
						<p><strong>PDF Naming Convention</strong></p>

						<p>Naming convention described here must be used. 
						Spaces CANNOT be used in file names. Dash punctuation mark can be used. (e.g. GolfDigest_2012_10.pdf)</p>

						<p><strong>Uploading an Issue as One PDF File</strong></p>

						<p>If your articles are always on single pages throughout all your issues, then you can upload the content as a single file containing all pages of a given issue. For this please use the following naming</p>
						<p>You can use number of an issue in filename: PublicationName_year_issue.pdf E.g. GolfDigest_2012_10.pdf or publication date in filename PublicationName_yyyy_mm_dd.pdf E.g. GolfDigest_20130617.pdf</p>

						<p><strong>Uploading an Issue Each Page as a Separate PDF File</strong></p>

						<p>If your articles are on multiple pages you can upload the content as a multiple file. Each file contains the number of pages comprising the article. Naming will then have continuous numbering as follows</p>
						<p>Using issue number in filename. PublicationName_year_issue_001.pdf Article starts from page 1 and ends on page 3 PublicationName_year_issue _004.pdf Article starts from page 4 and ends on page 7 PublicationName_year_issue _008.pdf ...and so on, to the last article of an issue</p>

						<p>OR using publication date in filename PublicationName _yyyymmdd_001.pdf Article starts from page 1 and ends on page 3 PublicationName _yyyymmdd_004.pdf Article starts from page 4 and ends on page 7 PublicationName _yyyymmdd_008.pdf ...and so on, to the last article and the last page of an issue</p>


						<h3>Shortcut Manager and Content Management</h3>

						<p>Extra content linked to pages of a publication can be managed with Shortcut Manager. It is a web tool used with browser and can be accessed on address: http://my.kooaba.com</p>
						<p>Publisher will get dedicated login details from local Shortcut representative.
						Adding Content to Pages

						Following steps are needed to add content to a page:
						•	Select Manager view (if you just logged in to Shortcut Manager)
						•	Select the publication from the left
						•	Open the issue you want to edit
						•	Open the page you want to manage
						•	Select ”Add resource”


						Picture 8.	Open the issue of a publication.


						Picture 9.	Select the page you want to edit.


						Picture 10.	Add the content link to the page ("Add Resource").

						Add the title and link to the extra content (resource), see below. "Title" is shown to the reader in Shortcut mobile app. "URI" is the Internet address of digital content to be added to the page.

						Picture 11.	"Add Resource", box where content details are added.

						"Locale" field is left empty and "Visibility" field should be set to "All Devices". When title and link are added just press "Create" button. After this material is added to the page and linked content is visible when page is scanned with Shortcut mobile app.
						Adding Content to an Issue Already Before Publication Date

						New issue can be created to the service already before final PDFs are ready. When publication date and the page count are known. New issue will be shown with empty pages in Shortcut Manager and content can be added already to these empty pages. Pages will be uploaded to the publication SFTP server when they are ready and service connects the links on empty pages with the final PDFs. It is important that the publication date and page count are matching with the final PDFs!

						First you select the publication and then press "New Issue", enter publication date and page count.


						Picture 12.	Creating a new issue. Enter the publication date and the page count.

						After this a new issue is created and all the pages are still empty. You can now create links to content on the pages as described already before in this document.

						When the final PDFs of the issue are ready they are imported to the service via publication´s SFTP account. Shortcut combines the PDFs and the links created to the empty issue created earlier.

						Statistics

						Shortcut provides statistics of service use. Statistics is anonymised and the individual user cannot be identified. The service gives statistics on what, when, and where pages are scanned with Shortcut Reader apps. Consumers can disable the location data from the mobile app. Typically at least half of the readers allow location sharing.

						Statistics can be found in Shortcut Manager, just click "Statistics". 


						Picture 13.	Statistics can be opened from Shortcut Manager.

						You can filter statistics by time and also most scanned pages can be seen.
						Location data is shown on "Map" section. Map can be zoomed in and out.
